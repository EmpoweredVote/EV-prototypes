    whatYoullLearn: "You'll learn about the scope of homelessness in Bloomington, how Indiana University affects the housing market, what \"Built for Zero\" means, the Housing Action Plan's goals, and how federal funding shapes local responses. This badge covers measurable data, governance structures, and the collaborative systems different organizations use to address housing insecurity.",
    whyItMatters: "Bloomington hosts approximately 305 people experiencing homelessness on any given night (2025 Point-in-Time count), with 142 of them unsheltered according to 2024 data—a doubling from 2023. The city has invested over $9 million in affordable housing programs since 2024, received a $7.39 million Lilly Endowment grant to add case managers, and became the first Indiana region to join the national Built for Zero initiative. Understanding the factual landscape helps residents and policymakers navigate these challenges with accurate information.",
    whatItIsNot: "You won't be asked what should happen or what the \"right\" solution is. This badge presents verified facts about: who experiences homelessness, how the housing market functions, what policies are in place, and what data shows about outcomes. You'll learn what is true, not what ought to be.",
